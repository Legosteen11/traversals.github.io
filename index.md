# What brings you here?

You found the home of **Traversal**.space. What is it that we do? Organic artisanal software development, of course.

Most of our current activity involves research and prototyping, partly dull and partly confidential. There are some open-source libraries that come out of it though, links to which you can find in the navigation bar.
